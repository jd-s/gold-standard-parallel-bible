# Evaluation data for the annotation of German and English New Testament texts with Strong's numbers

This repository holds a gold standard for parallel Bible texts and offers the annotation of 20 NT verses with Strong's numbers refering to Greek words.

We considered three German texts (Luther 2017, Schlachter and Hoffnung fÃ¼r alle) and two English texts (New Revised Standard Version and World English Bible):       

| Name        | Language | Year | Approach            |
|-------------|----------|------|---------------------|
| Luther 2017 | German   | 2017 | thought-for-thought |
| Schlachter  | German   | 2000 | word-for-word       |
| HFA         | German   | 2021 | paraphrase approach |
|-------------|----------|------|---------------------|
| NRSV        | English  | 1989 | paraphrase approach |
| WEB         | English  | 2015 | paraphrase approach |
|-------------|----------|------|---------------------|
## Background

Building a concordance of texts, automated text alignment and automated text translation are well-studied research topics. The data in this repository can be used to evaluate the task of automatically annotating words within New Testament texts in order to create parallel Bible corpora in different languages. Here, the goal is to create cross-lingual concordances for New Testament texts and translations. These are widely used for research and teaching. As an example use case we refer to [https://www.stepbible.org/].

## Selected verses

To evaluate non-annotated texts, we created gold standards for several verses and translations. We selected 20 verses from different books, both from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, and from different epistles. It was important to select a variety of verses, both from narrative texts (e.g. Mk 10:3; Lk 1:9; Jn 12:2, 21:1; Acts 8:14) and from Gospel-specific verses (e.g, Mark 1:1; John 19:35), enumerations (e.g., Acts 27:5), apocalyptic texts (Rev 1:19; 14:5), and letters (e.g., Rom 1:1; 12:4; Eph 1:8; 1 Peter 1:10; 1 John 1:5; Jude 1:8). 

## Documentation and Usage

The data comes as generic json file. In Python you may read this data with ```json``` library:
```
import json
f = open('bible-gs.json')
data = json.load(f)
```

Defining a Bible text and a verse makes the data directly accesible: 

```
verse = "1 John 1:5"
bible = "WEB"
text = "This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
# Pick a position and output the example annotation
i = 4
print ("'"+text.split(" ")[i]+"' -> G"+data[verse][bible][i])
```
